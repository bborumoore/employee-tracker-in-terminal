  ## Description
  
  #### Installation Instructions
  Clone this to your local machine, and run npm i to get all of the dependencies.  I have node.js installed, and this project uses the npm library. The full application also uses the path, fs, and express packages.

  ## How to Use
  The application runs entirely in the terminal.  Use npm start *server_name* to run the opening prompt, and manually select the options from there.  The interface should guide you through any requisite input requests using Inquirer.
